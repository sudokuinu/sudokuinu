- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @sudokuinu
- üëÄ the idea of sudoku came to us in april 2020 when the world was dealying with covid19 Pandemic , we saw the earge in the cryptocurrency world and we need to address it. so we came up with the idea of sudoku chain, soon after we started our business model and we began to design and develop, based on the explanation of question 2 we started our branding and adverting. to have a strong project we needed a great team of profissonal and exprienced indviduals which we began to hire and after a few months we have got an strong team of develpoing , marketing , design , financial and....
- üå± to make our project stronger we will not have any pre sale insted we will have a stratgec sale of 25 % of supplay the benfit that we earn from the sale it will be divaided into two porsions. 50% will be for launching and 50 % for project backup.
- üíûÔ∏è While the market for crypto projects is very hot today and we encounter a large number of them every day, the truth is that not all of these projects are successful and many of them fail, the biggest reason for which can be aimlessness or the very weak goal of these projects. Unfortunately, these projects are wasting people's time and money and destroying trust in the crypto world.
What is our target?
Sudoku team is proud to introduce its achievement to you after a lot of research and study,
The word sudoku is known to the public as a game, but sudoku is not just a game.
When we look at the Sudoku table, we see that a number of numbers with a certain order form the cells of 9 numbers, which we call a block, these blocks have both commonalities and distinctive features, which the designer basically uses to distinguish these blocks and form a complete system called Sudoku.
This is exactly what we want to do, we want to put the different fold blocks together as neatly as possible, using their commonalities and distinctions, and connect them together and finally we have a complete and comprehensive system.
- üì´ The Sudoku network consists of a large number of side chains that can connect different blockchains. This connection is very useful for the crypto community.
For example, suppose you want to buy a token or currency with your assets on the bep-20 network from the diff network (ETH). With the ETH network, transfer (first fee), then convert your assets from bep-20 to ETH (second fee), and finally buy the desired token with the amount of ETH ready (third fee), and finally if want to transfer back to your wallet includes the fourth fee.
However, with the Sudoku network, all these steps are done in one step and only in one step and a very low fee is requested from you and your transaction is done in the shortest possible time.
The source code of each sidechain is written very carefully and for special security in transactions, it uses the proprietary sudoku algorithm to confirm transactions, We have designed this algorithm to respect users' time and environment in such a way that transactions can be done in the shortest time and with the least energy consumption. Due to the very low energy consumption and the hardware used, our fee can be very low.
